## Problem Statement

FinMark Corporation has recently gained several new customers, each with multiple users. While business growth has been steadily increasing, the software and infrastructure were originally designed to handle only small-scale orders. With more customers now actively placing orders online, the current system and infrastructure have become overwhelmed and can no longer keep up with the growing demand.

The company aims to double its number of customers by the end of the year. However, with the current system limitations, it cannot support the projected number of users and orders. At present, the company’s online order placement system can handle up to 500 orders daily, but with increasing customer activity and the company’s growth targets, the demand is projected to rise to 3,000 orders per day.

As a result of these limitations, customers have begun raising multiple support tickets due to frequent system crashes and issues with order processing and handling.

To address this urgent situation, the Chief Technology Officer has proposed a project that builds a specialized team to take action. Project Finer FinMark is composed of the following specialists with specific roles:

 Software Developers must optimize the application to efficiently scale and handle a significantly larger number of users and daily transactions.
 Network & Cybersecurity Specialists must ensure that as the system scales, it remains secure and resilient—effectively minimizing crashes, safeguarding data, and preventing breaches.
 Data Analysts need to study ordering patterns, identify peak times that coincide with downtimes or errors, and help manage inventory by providing accurate demand forecasts.
