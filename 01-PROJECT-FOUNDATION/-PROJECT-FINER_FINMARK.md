# Project Finer FinMark

[FinMark](https://sites.google.com/mmdc.mcl.edu.ph/platformtech-finmark/what-we-need), a company providing data-driven financial services specializing in financial analysis, marketing analytics, and business intelligence, is expanding its operations. The company supports small and medium enterprises (SMEs) across Southeast Asia, helping them optimize marketing strategies and financial planning using advanced data analytics.

The Chief Technology Officer hired you as a consultant for their latest and biggest project to date. Project Finer FinMark aims to enhance its services. The company requires a scalable, secure, and data-driven platform that can support its growing SME client base. Your team, composed of Software Developers, Network and Cybersecurity Specialists, and Data Analysts, will focus on three major challenges:

---

## 1. Launching a Scalable App (mobile, desktop, or web) - The company needs a system that can handle rapid user growth.

- The company needs a high-performance SaaS (Software as a Service) platform that can scale to accommodate a growing number of SME clients.
- While the CTO hired you, your internal client is Michael Cruz, the COO.
- He clearly shared with you the following in one of your meetings. He ensured that you have shared goals as listed below, a clear statement of what he saw as the pain point, a qualified dashboard to support the set goals, and sample solutions previously offered by former teams who attempted to solve FinMark’s:

### Goals:

- Monitor real-time financial performance and order status.
- Ensure smooth and efficient operations across departments.
- Make quick, data-driven decisions based on up-to-date information.

### Pain Point:

- The dashboard, which is critical to operations, takes 20 seconds to load when accessed by all 200 employees—causing delays in reporting, bottlenecks in workflows, and missed opportunities for quick intervention.

### Need:

- A fast, scalable, and reliable dashboard that supports high concurrent usage, especially during peak business hours.

### Tools:

- Integrated Development Environments: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Programming Languages: [Python](https://www.python.org/) / [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)

### Former Solutions:

- Reducing dashboard load time to under 3 seconds.
- Implementing real-time data streaming solutions.
- Designing a dashboard with optimized backend queries and load balancing.
- Creating user-role based access to reduce unnecessary data pulls.

## 2. Building a Secure, Resilient Network - Security is a top priority to prevent cyber threats.

- Given the sensitive financial and marketing data involved, security is a top priority. The system must be resistant to cyber threats and ensure high availability.
- While the CTO hired you, your internal client is the CEO, Antonio Reyes, who was clear with his business strategy against data breach, especially that the company deals with financial information. He mentioned that this can damage the company’s brand and customer trust, and he wanted you to take note of the following.

### Goals:

- Ensure that the company's information is secure, especially financial data.
- Implement robust access control to limit who can view or manipulate sensitive data.
- Maintain system performance and security even during peak usage hours.

### Pain Points:

- Unauthorized access incidents have been reported, indicating weaknesses in the current security model.
- System slows down during peak hours, increasing the risk of vulnerabilities and reducing trust in the platform.

### Needs:

- A secure, role-based authentication system that ensures only authorized personnel can access specific data and functions.
- A scalable infrastructure that supports secure performance under heavy load.

### Tool:

- [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/cisco-packet-tracer)

### Other Considerations:

- Refer to the company’s [IT Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rHcPZqM79yiMCfvoG78dZAtuA_-H7fDb1kFUWJGQ3SQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.jtt03xnb5kvk).
- If provisions are missing, refer to the regional data security laws (e.g., PDPA, GDPR, PCI DSS) as a supplement.

---

## 3. Harnessing Big Data to Predict Market Trends - Data insights will help shape business strategies.

- While the CTO hired you, your internal client is the CMO, Jennifer Lee.
- She wants to advertise the business properly based on the growing demands of the customers but the company doesn't provide real time information which makes it challenging to make marketing decisions. She wants an AI powered system that could predict the market demands based on the real time data. Specifically, she mentioned the following:

### Goals:

- Launch timely and effective marketing campaigns based on actual market behavior.
- Ensure customer demand and order patterns are reflected in real-time marketing strategies.
- Make data-driven decisions about promotions, inventory push, and regional targeting.

### Pain Points:

- Lack of real-time data visibility from operations and customer behavior.
- Marketing decisions are delayed or based on outdated reports.
- Unable to anticipate market shifts, causing mismatched campaigns or poor timing.

### Needs:

- A real-time dashboard that integrates customer behavior, order volume, and system performance.
- An AI-powered predictive system to forecast market trends based on user activity, seasonal patterns, and order frequency.
- Marketing insights that can be translated into automated alerts or campaign triggers based on thresholds (e.g., “When product X spikes in interest, launch campaign Y”).

### Tools:

- Data Processing and Analysis: [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- Data Visualization: [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students), [PowerBI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- Process large dataset: [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)

### Other Considerations:

- Lee’s team expressed the following observable capabilities if possible:
  - Faster and smarter campaign launches that match actual customer demand.
  - Increased customer engagement through personalized and timely offers.
  - Strategic advantage by forecasting demand before competitors react.

You will be grouped according to your specialization. For the entire term, this is the same problem that you will need to address. Your key roles have an impact on the other teams because you want the platform of FinMark to work. You have to analyze these challenges and propose the best platform technologies to address them.
