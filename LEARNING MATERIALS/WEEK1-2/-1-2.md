# Expectations

Welcome to Platform Technologies! This is one of the last courses you need to take before graduating from MMDC. The best way to optimize your experience in this course is to tinker with available tools and respond to the needs of the tasks at hand.

For the entire run, imagine you’ve just been hired as a consultant for a fast-growing company, FinMark. Today is your first day. The Chief Technology Officer walks into the room, looks at you and your team, and says:

"We’re expanding, and we need your help. We need a platform that can scale, stay secure, and harness data like never before. You’re the experts, I trust that you will help this company perform better. So tell me, how do we do it?"

This course puts you in the driver’s seat. Over the next few weeks, you’ll think like a tech consultant, learning how to build scalable, secure, and data-driven platforms that power systems and/or businesses. Whether you’re majoring in software development, networking and cybersecurity, or data analytics, you’ll work on a real-world scenario where your decisions will shape the success of a company. As usual, you must think rationally and efficiently to successfully complete the milestones for this course.

As you use this guide, do the following:

1. Take note of any concept, topic, or terminology that is confusing, unclear, and/or unfamiliar to you. Conduct internet research, post a message and interact with your peers on your decided class platform, or schedule a mentoring session.
2. Manage your time wisely so you can complete the readings and/or activities in Camu before your next synchronous session.

# Expected Output

You are expected to complete the following tasks by the end of the week. Take note of the ones that are required to be submitted on Camu.

1. Form teams based on your specialization: Software Development, Network & Cybersecurity, or Data Analytics.
2. Begin drafting your Initial Consulting Report, where you'll outline your strategy and recommended solutions.
3. Start working on your Project Management tool.

# What Are Platform Technologies?

[](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf2RV-6qOT95FDcVtzTTUzpKCp2bjVCZSyGzJEU9qCF3QRCIcmY3gGUwrL4Ly84_tOICMK3SckVC2K8YiiIBPoHZT5ccGN_78UIojVDSrLQDNB3Kyt4X8an1MKohtTY7cRqiqB2FA?key=L9VDPWHvffJfoqi2W_j2kw)

Not this platform, you silly!

While talking about social inequalities has no better timing than every time, this course needs you to focus on the kind of platform that enables, not corrupts (or kills people) systems. But just like this film, it can be as horrendous as the events in this film when platform technology used by companies or businesses fail to be responsive to the needs of the client.

But what exactly are platform technologies, and why do they matter?

Platform technologies are traditionally defined as systems that provide the necessary tools and infrastructure to develop, run, and manage applications, networks, and data. Platform originally meant the “foundation that supported software” ([Rice](https://builtin.com/articles/what-is-a-platform), 2021). They help businesses scale, optimize operations, and enhance security.

If you were to be onboarded with this definition, it’s easy to liken scaling, optimizing operations, and enhancing security to a palengke (public market) like the photo below:

[](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdfxHkrK9o5PK4AnOn48tvh4jh_wP11Lm9c_IMUHYP8BpReyxdRh-3JP-6sGizTMYxyvT9_afE8ky57IzygeuasuQWnUnEezQgK2H0TJpCDYOPL5XfIXn6DQWm9u2dGH7qPWcb4Ag?key=L9VDPWHvffJfoqi2W_j2kw)

Palengke provides the necessary structure where different vendors, customers, and products interact seamlessly. You know exactly where the fish vendors are, who are most likely placed after the meat section, or where the fruit stalls are, which are most likely far from the poultry. Just like how a well-organized palengke has designated stalls, clear pathways, and a secure payment system (GCash and Paymaya are now even accepted in some stalls), a strong platform technology ensures that software, data, and networks work efficiently together. Without proper organization, the palengke becomes chaotic—just as a poorly built platform leads to inefficiencies, crashes, and security risks for a company. While one may argue that this is beyond IT specialization, [current demand](https://www.cio.com/article/230935/hiring-the-most-in-demand-tech-jobs-for-2021.html) in IT work would prove otherwise.

The definition of platform technologies, however, has broadened and expanded compared to its traditional definition. Notice how Airbnb, Facebook, and the like call themselves “platforms.” This is because in more recent usage, the word platform “is used as a shorthand for online content and information distributors”, apart from being “the foundations upon which software products are built, or the digital infrastructures that facilitate valuable interactions between participants (often in the form of marketplace businesses, like eBay, or social networks, like Twitter [now ‘X’) ([Rice](https://builtin.com/articles/what-is-a-platform), 2021).”

Bridgwater (2015) concisely summarizes the development of platform technologies’ definition and how they are applied:

Back at the early dawn of prehistory, we used to reserve our use of the word platform to denote a complete software programming development environment and underlying subsystem with language, runtime, components and all associated libraries and binaries. The result of using a platform (Microsoft .NET or Java for example) was a software application, [...]

In the next age of man, a platform became something slightly different. Where we used to think of a platform as the underlying computer system, we now probably have to accept the fact that the industry considers a platform to be anything that you can build upon. To be clearer, a platform could be your smartphone i.e. it has its own device form factor and its own ability to interconnect with other software streams, therefore it’s a platform that you can do other things with that were not originally envisaged at the time of its initial design – and this is the important point. [...]

Software has now moved from its previous ‘proven’ mode where it was stable, certain, systematic and mostly predictable to a new state of ‘agile’ where it is flexible, uncertain, exploratory and opportunistic. There’s still plenty of industry spin associated with the term platform, but digitization is driving home some new truths. Change is constant, so make plans to change plans.

If you think you need more explanation of the definition above, see a more detailed explanation below. Otherwise, skip the indented paragraphs.

Scalability in platform technology is like a jeepney route expanding to accommodate more passengers. Instead of SM North to Katipunan, jeepneys expanding their routes up to Batasang Pambansa surely accommodate more passengers. If the demand for a certain route grows but the number of jeepneys stays the same, passengers will have to wait longer, leading to inefficiencies and frustration. Other times, they may use a different mode of transportation, like Similarly, a business that does not invest in scalable platform technology will experience slow performance, system crashes, and customer dissatisfaction as the number of users increases. It must have been so much easier for a business to perform well when it only had 10 customers, and it’s a different story when it needs to show equal performance for 10, 000 more. Just like adding more jeepneys or shifting to bigger PUVs improves transport efficiency, scalable platforms ensure businesses can grow without interruptions. Remember, scalability is not just accommodating more (users, data, demand, etc.), it’s also doing so efficiently, cost-effectively, and seamlessly without compromising the quality of performance.

[](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfTHkpKFh02j7271SEuxK9xKWCHp0ZLdnFHSlGu2F6gm5XrEf2fOIy8UN08qLJw38b4e2-4ye6okVgQeS5uIH_Vu40UaBCrDdFRMKHBdm1lrW9eZxnmSkNUtdT0HxG-acpDaF4tfw?key=L9VDPWHvffJfoqi2W_j2kw)

Meanwhile, security in platform technologies is like locking that palengke stall you have at night and installing grills if possible. Without proper protection, thieves can break in and steal your valuable goods. In the digital world, failing to secure a platform exposes businesses to hackers, data breaches, and financial losses. Remember how the DFA data was [hacked](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/pinoyabroad/dispatch/921089/dfa-passport-data-breach/story/) last year or [LinkedIn](https://www.csoonline.com/article/534628/the-biggest-data-breaches-of-the-21st-century.html) in 2021? Apart from data breaches and angry clients, a platform technology that has poor cybersecurity can lead to financial losses, legal penalties, reputational damage, and even operational shutdowns due to ransomware attacks or system infiltrations. Businesses may also face compliance violations, loss of intellectual property, and exploitation by cybercriminals, making it difficult to regain customer trust and market credibility. Businesses that use firewalls, encryption, and authentication systems are like sari-sari store owners who double-lock their doors and install CCTV cameras, ensuring that their livelihood remains safe from intruders.

Lastly, platform technologies function like a palengke’s year-end party, where various committees—food, decorations, security, and entertainment—must coordinate to make the event successful. Think of how your company’s committees are built every end of the year, usually the new hires, just to make a program and have a good laugh of what they do. If one group fails to communicate properly, the party could be disorganized, like some people may not be able to eat due to incorrect estimation of food or be sick because there was not enough effort to know the allergies of people. Similarly, platform technologies connect different business components, allowing seamless automation, real-time data processing, and smooth operations. Without an integrated system, businesses operate where committees work separately, leading to miscommunication and inefficiencies.

[](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfcK41dxzuYmMPTZRW65WWBA56RYWlB9ntuLK5ARV4dRuIiZgzUNuTHDhHoTQr7FIt2zWzJC_9zHhmc9leeNC7fxa641CtkiQHClwtf0chsj4V4WfLsIYPLkEcuU4-AfBMKG36v?key=L9VDPWHvffJfoqi2W_j2kw)

Just as a well-managed palengke, a secure sari-sari store, an efficient jeepney system, and an organized year-end party make life easier, robust platform technologies enable businesses to scale, secure, and optimize their operations for long-term success. Investing in the right platform ensures that a company remains competitive, adaptable, and ready to grow in the ever-changing digital landscape.

Whether it is a software, a built network, treatment of data, or the combination of all, platform technologies are surely not just about the back-end set-up but also front-end where client experiences matter. It’s what clients experience that will affirm your effort or accuracy in doing the task. If you’re lucky enough, your future client may have stumbled upon Software AG CTO Wolfram Jost's bold statement, “Platform beats a product every time. [...] Software application development must evolve to reach a new level of adaptive applications that can be modified and adjusted (very often rapidly). This is because no single software vendor can foresee the business logic of a customer company for more than a couple of years.”

So why study Platform Technologies? Short answer: Your future clients will expect you to build one.

# What are examples of Platform Technologies?

Companies that thrive in a cutthroat economy are often those that build, optimize, or operate on robust platform technologies. Businesses like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Netflix are prime examples of how leveraging well-structured platforms can unlock massive scalability, foster innovation, and deliver seamless user experiences. Note that these companies didn’t just adopt technology—they BUILT ecosystems that support value-creating interactions, enable dynamic scaling, and harness data for continuous improvement. By examining their platforms, you can gain valuable insights into the architecture, strategies, and core features that drive successful platform-based businesses. This helps you prepare for your first Milestone for this course.

1. Cloud Migration

As you’ve watched or read, Netflix’s   [cloud migration]([https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-cloud-migration#:~:text=Cloud migration definition,but also between different clouds.)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-cloud-migration#:~:text=Cloud%20migration%20definition,but%20also%20between%20different%20clouds.))  was a game-changer, allowing the company to transition from physical data centers to a fully cloud-based infrastructure on   [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw4cS-BhDGARIsABg4_J18jHqKEBAuKROOwr93UpnhC_KPJOwf-1HahnTKqJQlgakp-9U1nbgaAsUYEALw_wcB&trk=c4f45c53-585c-4b31-8fbf-d39fbcdc603a&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=Cj0KCQjw4cS-BhDGARIsABg4_J18jHqKEBAuKROOwr93UpnhC_KPJOwf-1HahnTKqJQlgakp-9U1nbgaAsUYEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!637354294239!e!!g!!aws!19043613274!143453611386&all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=all#)  (AWS). Cloud migration has  three main managed service models: IaaS, SaaS, and PaaS. See the diagram below to better understand these three:

[](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe-iOmAZy6QezHLnizjOjpzt3Y6r-WlxOhr3JRE8ZIn85O1Lb_fCgGa0nG93z3RdPEygsGX4yDSnLpEF0UCCURG1mZRrI1fQHaffTAAQNsI52NYGKuWStmIcGyDKq-P1nnzSy7gew?key=L9VDPWHvffJfoqi2W_j2kw)

[Image source](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-cloud-migration#managed-services)

1. (infrastructure as a service) allows you to quickly scale up and down as demand changes, letting you pay only for what you use. It helps you avoid the expense and complexity of buying and managing your own physical servers and other datacenter infrastructure.
   [IaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-iaas/)
2. An example of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is  (EC2).
   [Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-elastic-compute-cloud-ec2/)
3. A WS EC2 provides virtual servers (instances) that businesses can rent on demand instead of maintaining physical servers. Companies use EC2 to host applications, process large amounts of data, and scale resources up or down based on traffic needs. Since AWS handles the networking, storage, and server maintenance, businesses can focus on their software and applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
4. (platform as a service) includes the benefits of IaaS, but includes managed developer tools, databases, business analytics, and operating systems. It's ideal for reducing development costs and accelerating development time.
   [PaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-paas/)
5. An example of Platform as a Service (PaaS) is  .
   [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine)
6. Google App Engine allows developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure, such as servers, storage, or networking. It automatically scales applications based on demand and supports multiple programming languages like Python, Java, Node.js, and more. Since Google handles server management, security, and load balancing, developers can focus on writing and improving their applications instead of maintaining infrastructure.
7. (software as a service) includes IaaS and PaaS, but includes the added convenience of app hosting, which allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps (such as email and office apps) over the Internet.
   [SaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-saas/)
8. An example of Software as a Service (SaaS) is  (formerly G Suite).
   [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/intl/en_ph/)
9. Google Workspace includes cloud-based applications like Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Meet, allowing users to collaborate, store files, and communicate online without installing software on their devices. Since Google hosts and maintains the platform, users only need an internet connection to access their documents and emails from anywhere.

Since  Netflix is a streaming service that delivers movies and TV shows over the internet without requiring users to download content, it falls under the SaaS model. SaaS is ideal for users and businesses who want ready-to-use software that is accessible from any device without dealing with updates, maintenance, or server management. This shift enabled seamless content streaming worldwide, reducing downtime and improving content delivery through auto-scaling and distributed computing.

2. Autoscaling

[Autoscaling](https://www.vmware.com/topics/auto-scaling), as illustrated below, “is a cloud computing technique for dynamically allocating computational resources. Depending on the load to a server farm or pool, the number of servers that are active will typically vary automatically as user needs fluctuate. Auto scaling and load balancing are related because an application typically scales based on load balancing serving capacity. In other words, the serving capacity of the load balancer is one of several metrics (including cloud monitoring metrics and CPU utilization) that shapes the auto scaling policy.” A robust and scalable web structure ensures efficient user request handling, prevents server overload, and adapts to increased traffic via scaling strategies. The use of a load balancer is critical for distributing traffic and maintaining system reliability. Study the diagram below:

[](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeuu2H9z67dCB732lMLy5wl2CnoTOeHFmSOwiqgPnZPxNkTbI-VkbHoKB7lbuefYsd8DTfGm0Q1anThG24OwP0O-eZ9iy_YqZ10cy6fu6H2Gi4kQ6iK-1Cn_vzBcQBcpSn0EnQ1Dw?key=L9VDPWHvffJfoqi2W_j2kw)

[Image Source](https://www.vmware.com/topics/auto-scaling)

Simply put, autoscaling ensures that cloud application workloads and services consistently deliver optimal performance and maintain high accessibility levels, adapting seamlessly to varying conditions. This architecture begins with Application Clients (End Users), who access the application from various devices. Their interaction with the system occurs via the Internet, which serves as the communication medium between the users and the system infrastructure. At the core of the system is the Load Balancer, which acts as an intermediary between the users and the servers housed in the Data Center. The load balancer distributes incoming user requests evenly across multiple servers, ensuring optimal performance and preventing any single server from being overwhelmed. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining the system's high availability and reliability.

Within the Data Center, the application's servers are hosted, employing two scalability strategies to handle varying workloads. Scaling Up involves adding more resources, such as CPU or RAM, to existing servers to manage higher loads. Alternatively, Scaling Out involves adding more servers (replicated servers) to distribute the load across multiple instances. These Replicated Servers, which are duplicates of the primary servers, can be activated as demand increases or when additional resources are required. This horizontal scaling approach ensures the system can adapt effectively to increased traffic and maintain seamless performance. One known reputable vendor that provides autoscaling is AWS. By leveraging AWS’s global data centers, Netflix ensures that millions of users can stream content without buffering, even during peak hours.

3. Distributed Computing

Distributed computing is a method where multiple computers work together as a single system to process data and solve complex problems. These computers, often called  nodes  , communicate over a network and share workloads, enabling efficient task execution.

Below are the key features of Distributed Computing that companies, like Netflix, use to optimize their operations:

1. Parallel Processing: Tasks are divided and processed simultaneously across multiple machines.
2. Scalability: Systems can grow by adding more nodes, increasing computing power as needed.
3. Fault Tolerance: If one node fails, others can take over, ensuring system reliability.
4. Resource Sharing: Computing power, storage, and network resources are shared for optimized performance.

If you think you need more information about Distributed Computing, read this [article](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/distributed-computing/#:~:text=Distributed%20computing%20is%20the%20method,to%20deal%20with%20complex%20challenges)  from AWS.

The first three items are those leveraged by Netflix well. Of course, it’s worth noting that such is a product of all the teams that put their minds onto the goal of making the operations and functions smoother. To have a bird’s eye view of these items employed, watch this [female Netflix Engineer’s]([https://www.camuerp.com/This architecture enables smooth, high-quality video conferencing even in low-bandwidth environments, making Zoom a critical tool for businesses, educators, and remote teams worldwide.)](https://www.camuerp.com/This%20architecture%20enables%20smooth,%20high-quality%20video%20conferencing%20even%20in%20low-bandwidth%20environments,%20making%20Zoom%20a%20critical%20tool%20for%20businesses,%20educators,%20and%20remote%20teams%20worldwide.)) interview.

4. Other Similar Platforms that Leveraged Tech for Business
5. Amazon’s recommendation engine is another example of how platform technologies drive business success. By utilizing  and , Amazon can analyze user behavior, purchase history, and browsing patterns to offer highly personalized product recommendations. This system operates on an advanced AI-driven platform that continuously refines suggestions based on real-time interactions.

# What are the key qualities of an effective platform technology?

Netflix, Amazon, and Zoom are common cases that best exemplify how companies leverage technology to ensure efficiency (and frankly, profit). What features are commonly shared among these platform technologies?

Drawing from "Platform Revolution" by Parker, Van Alstyne, and Choudary, a good platform technology is one that enables and enhances value-creating interactions between producers and consumers. The authors explain that platform businesses thrive not just because of the technology itself, but because of how well the platform facilitates exchanges and builds ecosystems. If you refer to their book, the following items have been discussed as key features of what makes a good platform technology:

1. Enables Value-Creating Interactions
2. The primary function of a platform is to facilitate the exchange of value between users (e.g., buyers and sellers, creators and consumers)
3. A good platform allows these interactions to happen easily, efficiently, and at scale.
4. Example: Uber connects riders and drivers through a seamless app interface.
5. Has a Powerful Core Interaction
6. Every successful platform revolves around a core interaction—users, value units (e.g., videos, rides, products), and filters (to match supply and demand).
7. A good platform clearly defines and optimizes this interaction.
8. Key Components :
9. Participants
10. Value Units (e.g., posts, listings, services)
11. Filters/Algorithms (e.g., ranking, recommendations)
12. Facilitates Network Effects
13. The more users join and participate, the more valuable the platform becomes for everyone.
14. A good platform technology supports positive network effects (especially same-side and cross-side).
15. Cross-side Example : More Airbnb guests attract more hosts, and vice versa.
16. Provides Tools for Easy Access and Participation
17. Good platforms offer APIs, SDKs, documentation, and intuitive UX/UI that lower the barrier for participation and development.
18. They should make it easy for third parties to build, connect, and contribute.
19. Think: YouTube for creators, Apple’s App Store for developers
20. Governance and Control Mechanisms
21. A platform must balance openness (to attract users and creators) with control (to maintain quality and trust).
22. Good platform technology includes rating systems, moderation tools, and security protocols.
23. Governance ensures healthy interactions, reduces spam, and increases user trust.
24. Supports Modularity and Scalability
25. Great platforms are built with modularity in mind—they allow for expansion, plugins, and integrations.
26. This makes it easier to scale and adapt to evolving market needs or user behaviors.
27. Modularity supports third-party innovation without breaking core services.
28. Data as an Asset
29. Platforms thrive on data. A good platform technology captures, analyzes, and leverages data to improve user experiences, recommendations, and ecosystem health.
30. Data enables better matchmaking, personalization, and fraud detection.
31. Encourages Ecosystem Development
32. The best platforms create networked ecosystems where producers, consumers, and third parties can thrive.
33. Good platform tech encourages co-creation, not just consumption.

# What are the risks associated with poor Platform Technologies?

Using poor platform technology can severely impact businesses, leading to inefficiencies, security vulnerabilities, and financial losses.

Take this less-than-two-minute case video of [The Knight Capital Losses](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a0LInb_O64l23ZWFVTo4973M1aRF7WSO/view?usp=drive_link).

Although the case above was not primarily a scalability issue, but rather a faulty software deployment and risk management failure, some aspects of the incident do highlight platform scalability concerns, particularly in how the system handled changes and updates in a high-frequency trading (HFT) environment. The system did not crash due to excessive load or inability to handle traffic, but it did expose weaknesses in scalable system design, i.e., poor version control across multiple servers, failure to integrate new software with legacy code, lack of a centralized kill switch to stop runaway trades, and no automated risk throttling mechanism, which scalable trading systems typically include. Further, a poorly designed platform may struggle to handle increasing traffic or data loads, leading to slow performance, frequent crashes, and downtime. This is especially critical for businesses that rely on real-time services, such as streaming platforms or e-commerce websites. If a company’s infrastructure cannot scale efficiently, it risks losing customers who experience delays and interruptions in service. Refer to the other offshoots of having poor platform technology:

1. Security vulnerabilities and data breaches. A classic example of how weak platform technology, poor security practices, and failure to update systems can lead to devastating consequences, including massive financial losses, legal liabilities and fines, and worst, loss of customer trust is the Equifax Data Breach in 2017. Watch a 2-minute summary video .
   [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DFKjubpQIlRYB4XVp32gRfG6-yot8otB/view?usp=drive_link)
2. Cyberattacks, hacks, and ransomware. A platform with outdated authentication methods or poor encryption practices can expose sensitive user information, leading to legal liabilities and loss of customer trust. Companies that fail to implement robust security measures often face compliance violations, fines, and reputational damage that can be difficult to recover from.
3. High maintenance costs and inefficiencies. It can become a burden when relying on outdated or incompatible platforms. A company using  may struggle with expensive infrastructure upgrades, slow deployment cycles, and constant manual interventions. In contrast, a well-optimized platform allows businesses to automate processes, reduce operational costs, and focus resources on growth and innovation. To better understand their differences, see the table below:
   [on-premises servers instead of cloud-based solutions](https://www.hpe.com/emea_europe/en/what-is/on-premises-vs-cloud.html)

| Disaster Recovery    | Requires in-house backup solutions and disaster recovery plans                   | Built-in disaster recovery and redundancy mechanisms                       |
| Compliance           | Full control over compliance but requires dedicated effort to maintain standards | Compliant with various standards but depends on provider policies          |
| Customization        | Fully customizable but depends on internal resources and expertise               | Limited customization but offers flexibility through APIs and integrations |

1. Integration and compatibility issues. Many modern businesses require seamless connections between different software solutions, databases, and . If a platform lacks the ability to integrate with emerging technologies, businesses face operational bottlenecks and reduced efficiency. For instance, in 2013, the U.S. government launched [Healthcare.gov](http://Healthcare.gov), an online health insurance marketplace for the ). The platform was supposed to allow millions of Americans to compare and purchase health insurance plans easily. However, its launch was plagued with major integration and compatibility issues, leading to severe usability failures. Users would often see the screen below, with common endings of not availing any healthcare service at all:
   [APIs](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/api/)
   [Affordable Care Act (ACA](https://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/about-the-aca/index.html)
2. Poor user experience and customer satisfaction. A slow, unreliable, or glitchy platform can frustrate users and drive them toward competitors. In the case of [Healthcare.gov](http://Healthcare.gov), however, it was just taxing (did you get this pun) to look for another government. In today’s digital economy, customers expect seamless interactions, fast response times, and secure transactions. If an e-commerce website suffers from slow loading speeds or frequent payment failures, customers will quickly abandon their carts and switch to a more efficient competitor. As opined by  (2013), the glitchy [Healthcare.gov](http://Healthcare.gov) does not really have rare errors, but a high-profile failure of integration (due to two contractors working on different modules in one platform!) of end-to-end systems made it to the headlines.
   [Auerbach](https://slate.com/business/2013/10/what-went-wrong-with-healthcare-gov-the-front-end-and-back-end-never-talked-to-each-other.html)
3. Poor data insights and weak decision-making capabilities. Without a robust data analytics platform, companies fail to capture meaningful insights into customer behavior, market trends, and operational inefficiencies. This results in missed opportunities for growth and a lack of informed decision-making. Businesses that leverage big data and AI-driven analytics are able to predict customer needs, personalize experiences, and optimize processes effectively.

In summary, poor platform technology can increase costs, compromise security, damage user experience, and limit business growth. Investing in scalable, secure, and integrated platforms is essential for businesses to remain competitive in an increasingly digital landscape.

By the end of Week 2, you should have a solid understanding of platform technologies and a clear plan for your consulting project. If you do not feel confident about this, consult with your groupmates. As a group, outline your concerns and compile them to see how each of you can first help with your concerns. When there are remaining items for resolution, book a mentoring session as soon as you can.

Excited to see what you come up with!
