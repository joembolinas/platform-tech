## Problem Statement

### Current System Limitations

FinMark Corporation has experienced rapid business growth, gaining several new customers with multiple users each. However, the existing software and infrastructure were originally designed for small-scale operations and are now overwhelmed.

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Scalability Crisis:** Current system handles 500 orders daily, but projected demand is 3,000 orders per day
2. **Performance Degradation:** Dashboard takes 20 seconds to load with 200 concurrent users
3. **Security Vulnerabilities:** Unauthorized access incidents reported
4. **System Instability:** Frequent crashes and processing issues leading to customer support tickets
5. **Business Impact:** Cannot support projected doubling of customer base by year-end

**Consequences:**
- Customer dissatisfaction due to system downtime
- Operational bottlenecks during peak business hours
- Delayed decision-making due to slow dashboard performance
- Security risks with sensitive financial data
- Missed business opportunities
