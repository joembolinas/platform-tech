## 1. Milestone 1 Alignment and Foundation

### 1.1 Proposed Network Architecture Implementation

**Current State (Based on Milestone 1 Analysis):**

- Flat network topology with minimal segmentation
- Single VLAN for all departments (major security risk)
- Outdated firewall rules and access controls
- Bandwidth bottlenecks during peak business hours (8-10 AM, 2-4 PM)
- Missing DMZ implementation for external services

**Milestone 1 Proposed Architecture to Implement:**

- **VLAN Segmentation Strategy:**

  - VLAN 10: Finance Department (SOX compliance requirements)
  - VLAN 20: HR Department (sensitive employee data)
  - VLAN 30: General Operations (day-to-day business functions)
  - VLAN 40: IT Infrastructure (network management and monitoring)
  - VLAN 50: DMZ (external-facing services and web servers)
- **Security Zone Implementation:**

  - Internal Network Zones with micro-segmentation
  - DMZ with proper firewall rules for external access
  - Management Network for administrative access
  - Guest Network isolation for visitor access
- **Performance Optimization Framework:**

  - QoS policies prioritizing financial transactions and critical business applications
  - Load balancing for file servers and database access
  - Bandwidth management addressing peak hour congestion
  - Redundant paths for business-critical connections

### 1.2 Security Enhancement Framework (Milestone 1 Recommendations)

**Identified Vulnerabilities to Address:**

- Inadequate network access controls
- Missing intrusion detection and prevention systems
- Insufficient monitoring and logging capabilities
- Weak authentication mechanisms
- Compliance gaps for SOX and PCI-DSS requirements

**Proposed Security Implementation:**

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) deployment
