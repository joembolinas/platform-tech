| What technologies will you need to develop or integrate to solve the problem?           | TRUE     | "To solve the problem, we will integrate the following technologies:1. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) - Implementing RBAC ensures that users only access the data necessary for their roles, adhering to the principle of least privilege. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and simplifies permission management. According to Syteca, RBAC enhances security by reducing the attack surface and limiting potential breaches. It also streamlines user management, making it easier to onboard, offboard, and modify user roles without manual intervention (Authgear, 2024). https://www.syteca.com/en/glossary/what-is-rbac? https://www.authgear.com/post/what-is-role-based-access-control-rbac-benefits-comparisons-and-best-practices?2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of verification before accessing sensitive systems. According to Microsoft, MFA can block over 99.9% of account compromise attacks. A study on Microsoft Azure Active Directory users found that MFA implementation offers outstanding protection, with over 99.99% of MFA-enabled accounts remaining secure during the investigation period. https://www.fortifyframework.com/multi-factor-authentication/? https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00945?3. Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud Infrastructure â€“ AWS is the worldâ€™s leading cloud computing provider, having pioneered the cloud revolution and maintained its dominance. It boasts the largest network of data centers among cloud providers, ensuring high reliability and solid performance. Businesses can strategically place applications in regions closest to their customers for optimized speed. AWS is user-friendly, designed for quick and easy access while offering comprehensive monitoring and management tools. It supports various web application services, enabling users to select the best features and server operating systems based on their programming needs. Security is a cornerstone of AWS, with a strong track record and few notable security incidents since its inception in 2006. https://www.techradar.com/best/best-cloud-computing-services?4. API Gateway with Authentication & Throttling â€“ Utilizing an API Gateway (e.g., AWS API Gateway) helps secure backend systems by enforcing authentication, request validation, and traffic throttling. It protects against excessive requests and abuse while offering detailed analytics and monitoring for visibility into API traffic. This directly addresses the backend pain points like unsecured APIs and limited threat visibility. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-request-throttling.html 5. Zero Trust Security Model â€“ Zero Trust operates on the assumption that no user or system should be trusted by default, whether inside or outside the network. It emphasizes continuous verification, least privilege access, and micro-segmentation. This model reduces the blast radius in case of a breach and ensures tight control over lateral movement. https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/" |

If the team isnâ€™t familiar with cloud infrastructure, we can hire specialists or provide training to help with the transition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Do you require any third-party services (e.g., APIs, cloud platforms, analytics tools)? | TRUE     | Yes, for managing who gets access, we'll need third-party services such as AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) or AWS Directory Service. And for our scalable and secure infrastructure, we'll rely on a cloud platform like Amazon Web Services (AWS).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
