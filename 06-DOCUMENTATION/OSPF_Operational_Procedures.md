# Triggered by monitoring system alert

NEIGHBOR_IP=$1
LOCAL_ROUTER=$2

echo "ALERT: OSPF Neighbor Down - $NEIGHBOR_IP on $LOCAL_ROUTER"
echo "Time: $(date)"

# Step 1: Verify the issue
echo "1. Verifying neighbor status..."
ssh $LOCAL_ROUTER "show ip ospf neighbor $NEIGHBOR_IP detail"

# Step 2: Check interface status
echo "2. Checking interface status..."
ssh $LOCAL_ROUTER "show interfaces | include line protocol"

# Step 3: Check for authentication issues
echo "3. Checking authentication..."
ssh $LOCAL_ROUTER "show ip ospf interface | include authentication"

    echo "  Check $i: Neighbor state = $neighbor_state"
    
    if [[ "$neighbor_state" == "FULL" ]]; then
        echo "✓ Neighbor recovered successfully"
        send_recovery_notification
        exit 0
    fi
done

# If not recovered, escalate
echo "✗ Neighbor did not recover - escalating to Level 2"
escalate_incident "OSPF Neighbor Down" "$NEIGHBOR_IP" "$LOCAL_ROUTER"
```

#### **Escalation Response (5-15 minutes)**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Level 2 OSPF Troubleshooting

echo "Level 2 OSPF Troubleshooting - Detailed Analysis"

# Advanced diagnostics
echo "Running advanced diagnostics..."

# Check physical layer

# Analyze OSPF debug logs
analyze_ospf_debug_logs $LOCAL_ROUTER

# Check for routing loops
detect_routing_loops

# Verify LSA database consistency
verify_lsa_consistency

# Check network connectivity
test_ip_connectivity $LOCAL_ROUTER $NEIGHBOR_IP

# Generate detailed incident report
generate_incident_report
```

### **Routing Loop Detection and Resolution**

#### **Loop Detection Script**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Routing Loop Detection

echo "===== Routing Loop Detection ====="

# Test for loops using traceroute
test_destinations=(
    "10.1.50.10"  # DMZ Web Server
    "10.2.10.5"   # Finance VLAN
    "10.2.20.5"   # HR VLAN
    "10.3.10.1"   # Security Router
)

for dest in "${test_destinations[@]}"; do
    echo "Testing path to $dest..."
    traceroute $dest | tee traceroute_$dest.log
    
    # Analyze for loops (repeated IP addresses)
    loop_count=$(sort traceroute_$dest.log | uniq -d | wc -l)
    if [ $loop_count -gt 0 ]; then
        echo "✗ LOOP DETECTED to $dest"
        analyze_routing_loop $dest
        send_critical_alert "Routing loop detected to $dest"
    else
        echo "✓ No loop detected to $dest"
    fi
done
```

#### **Loop Resolution Procedure**
```cisco
! Emergency loop resolution
! Run on affected routers

! 1. Identify the loop source
show ip route | include loop
show ip ospf database router

! 2. Temporary fix - increase interface cost
interface gigabitethernet X/X
ip ospf cost 65535

! 3. Clear OSPF database to force recalculation
clear ip ospf process

! 4. Monitor for resolution
show ip route ospf
```

### **Incident Escalation Matrix**

```

### **Performance Optimization Procedures**

#### **OSPF Timer Optimization**
```cisco
! Optimize OSPF timers for faster convergence
! Apply during maintenance windows

interface range gigabitethernet 0/1 - 2
 ip ospf hello-interval 5
 ip ospf dead-interval 20
 
! For critical links, use even faster timers
interface gigabitethernet 0/1
 ip ospf hello-interval 1
 ip ospf dead-interval 4
 
! Monitor CPU impact after changes
show processes cpu | include OSPF
```

#### **LSA Throttling Configuration**
```cisco
! Configure LSA throttling to prevent flapping
router ospf 1
 timers throttle spf 1 5 10
 timers throttle lsa 0 5 10
 timers lsa arrival 1000

! These settings provide:
! - SPF delay: 1ms initial, 5ms minimum, 10ms maximum
! - LSA throttling: 0ms initial, 5ms minimum, 10ms maximum  
! - LSA arrival: minimum 1000ms between same LSA
```

## 📚 Knowledge Management

### **Common OSPF Issues and Solutions**

#### **Issue 1: Neighbor Adjacency Failures**
**Symptoms:**
- Neighbors stuck in EXSTART or EXCHANGE state
- Frequent neighbor Up/Down messages
- Routing table inconsistencies

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
```cisco
! 1. Check interface status
show ip ospf interface brief

! 2. Verify IP connectivity
ping neighbor_ip

! 3. Check OSPF configuration
show ip ospf interface detail

! 4. Verify area configuration
show ip ospf | include Area

! 5. Check authentication
show ip ospf interface | include Message
```

**Common Solutions:**
- Verify area numbers match
- Check authentication keys
- Ensure MTU sizes match
- Verify IP subnet configuration

#### **Issue 2: Slow Convergence**
**Symptoms:**
- Convergence times >5 seconds
- Delayed route updates
- Temporary routing loops

**Optimization Actions:**
```cisco
! Tune OSPF timers
interface gigabitethernet 0/1
 ip ospf hello-interval 1
 ip ospf dead-interval 4

! Optimize SPF throttling
router ospf 1
 timers throttle spf 1 1 5

! Reduce LSA propagation delay
router ospf 1
 timers lsa arrival 100
```

#### **Issue 3: High CPU Utilization**
**Symptoms:**
- OSPF process consuming >50% CPU
- Slow router response
- Intermittent neighbor flapping

**Resolution Steps:**
```cisco
! Check SPF frequency
show ip ospf | include SPF

! Implement LSA throttling
router ospf 1
 timers throttle lsa 100 1000 5000

! Reduce hello frequency on stable links
interface gigabitethernet 0/2
 ip ospf hello-interval 10
 ip ospf dead-interval 40
```
